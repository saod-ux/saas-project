# Multi-Tenant Security Model

## Overview

This document outlines the security model for our multi-tenant SaaS application, focusing on tenant isolation, access control, and data protection.

## Threat Model

### Primary Threats

1. **Cross-Tenant Data Access**: Unauthorized access to data belonging to other tenants
2. **Privilege Escalation**: Users gaining access to resources beyond their role
3. **Data Leakage**: Sensitive tenant data being exposed to unauthorized parties
4. **Injection Attacks**: Malicious data being injected into tenant-specific queries
5. **Authentication Bypass**: Unauthorized access to tenant resources

### Secondary Threats

1. **Resource Exhaustion**: Tenants consuming excessive resources
2. **Data Corruption**: Malicious or accidental data modification
3. **Audit Trail Tampering**: Modification of audit logs

## Security Architecture

### Authentication Layers

1. **Platform Level**: Firebase Auth for platform administrators
2. **Tenant Level**: JWT tokens for customer authentication
3. **API Level**: Service account authentication for server-to-server communication

### Authorization Model

#### Role Hierarchy

```
SUPER_ADMIN (Platform)
├── ADMIN (Platform)
├── OWNER (Tenant)
├── ADMIN (Tenant)
├── STAFF (Tenant)
└── CUSTOMER (Tenant)
```

#### Access Control Matrix

| Resource | Platform Admin | Tenant Owner | Tenant Admin | Tenant Staff | Customer |
|----------|---------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| Platform Settings | R/W | - | - | - | - |
| Tenant Settings | R/W | R/W | R/W | R | - |
| Products | R/W | R/W | R/W | R | R |
| Categories | R/W | R/W | R/W | R | R |
| Orders | R/W | R/W | R/W | R/W | R (own) |
| Payments | R/W | R/W | R/W | R/W | R (own) |
| Users | R/W | R/W | R/W | R | R (own) |

## Firestore Security Rules

### Core Principles

1. **Tenant Isolation**: All data access is scoped by `tenantId`
2. **Role-Based Access**: Access is determined by user role and membership
3. **Least Privilege**: Users can only access data they need for their role
4. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of validation and access control

### Rule Categories

#### Platform-Level Rules
- `platformAdmins`: Only platform administrators can access
- `auditLogs`: Platform administrators only
- `tenants`: Platform administrators and tenant administrators (read-only for tenant admins)

#### Tenant-Scoped Rules
- All tenant data must include `tenantId` field
- Access is granted based on user's membership in the tenant
- Cross-tenant access is explicitly denied

#### User-Specific Rules
- Users can only access their own user documents
- Customer data is scoped to their tenant and user ID
- Order and payment access is restricted to owners and staff

## Data Model Security

### Required Fields

All tenant-scoped documents must include:
- `tenantId`: String identifying the tenant
- `createdAt`: Timestamp for audit purposes
- `updatedAt`: Timestamp for audit purposes

### Sensitive Data Handling

1. **Personal Information**: Stored with proper encryption
2. **Payment Data**: Handled by secure payment processors
3. **Authentication Tokens**: Stored securely with expiration
4. **Audit Logs**: Immutable and tamper-evident

## API Security

### Input Validation

1. **Zod Schemas**: All API endpoints use Zod for input validation
2. **Tenant Resolution**: Centralized tenant resolution prevents ID confusion
3. **Role Verification**: Server-side role verification for all operations

### Rate Limiting

1. **Per-Tenant Limits**: API calls are rate-limited per tenant
2. **Per-User Limits**: Individual user rate limits
3. **Resource Limits**: Storage and compute resource limits

## Testing Strategy

### Security Test Matrix

| Test Category | Description | Frequency |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| Tenant Isolation | Verify no cross-tenant data access | Every deployment |
| Role Permissions | Test all role-based access controls | Weekly |
| Input Validation | Test malicious input handling | Every deployment |
| Authentication | Test auth bypass scenarios | Weekly |
| Data Integrity | Verify data consistency | Daily |

### Automated Tests

1. **Smoke Tests**: Basic tenant isolation verification
2. **Integration Tests**: Full workflow security testing
3. **Penetration Tests**: External security assessment
4. **Compliance Tests**: Regulatory requirement verification

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Classification

1. **Critical**: Cross-tenant data breach, authentication bypass
2. **High**: Unauthorized access, data corruption
3. **Medium**: Rate limit bypass, audit log issues
4. **Low**: Minor permission issues, configuration problems

### Response Procedures

1. **Immediate**: Isolate affected systems, notify stakeholders
2. **Short-term**: Investigate, patch vulnerabilities, restore services
3. **Long-term**: Post-incident review, security improvements

## Compliance and Auditing

### Audit Requirements

1. **Access Logs**: All data access is logged with user, tenant, and timestamp
2. **Change Logs**: All data modifications are tracked
3. **Authentication Logs**: Login attempts and failures are recorded
4. **API Logs**: All API calls are logged with request/response details

### Compliance Standards

1. **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy requirements
2. **SOC 2**: Security and availability controls
3. **PCI DSS**: Payment card data security (if applicable)
4. **HIPAA**: Healthcare data protection (if applicable)

## Security Best Practices

### Development

1. **Secure Coding**: Follow OWASP guidelines
2. **Code Reviews**: Security-focused code reviews
3. **Dependency Management**: Regular security updates
4. **Secret Management**: Secure handling of API keys and tokens

### Operations

1. **Monitoring**: Continuous security monitoring
2. **Backups**: Secure and encrypted backups
3. **Updates**: Regular security patches and updates
4. **Training**: Security awareness training for team

## Future Improvements

### Planned Enhancements

1. **Advanced Analytics**: Security event correlation and analysis
2. **Automated Response**: Automated incident response capabilities
3. **Compliance Automation**: Automated compliance checking
4. **Security Training**: Enhanced security training programs

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Regular Assessments**: Quarterly security assessments
2. **Penetration Testing**: Annual external penetration testing
3. **Security Updates**: Monthly security update reviews
4. **Incident Drills**: Quarterly incident response drills
